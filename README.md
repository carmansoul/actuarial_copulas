This code generates copula models and graphs for actuarial data provided by Wisconsin School of Business' Regression Modeling with Actuarial and Financial Applications. This was for my capstone mathematics course, where we analyzed the dependence structure of several variables. Copulas are a valuable tool for analyzing dependence structure. Many copulas have been generated for various applications. This code finds the copula of best fit for the bivariate case using AIC, BIC, and Log-Likelihood, and determines the correct parameters. We used this to write a research paper studying the mathematical properties of the generated copulas, particularly overall dependence measures and upper- and lower-tail dependence. Our conclusion was that for some datasets (those with many degrees of freedom) copulas have better fit regardless of dependence. For ranked datasets, copulas are useful for preliminary results before gathering more data.
